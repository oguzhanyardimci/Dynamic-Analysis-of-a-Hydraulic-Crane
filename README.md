# Dynamic-Analysis-of-a-Hydraulic-Crane
A hydraulic crane was designed by using Solidworks and made dynamic analysis in MATLAB by using Simscape Multibody Toolbox.

ABOUT THE PROJECT

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the static and dynamic solutions that are different. 
We can find the value statically using analytical equations. 
Otherwise, we can use MATLAB Simulink to find the value of dynamical calculations using the Multibody Simscape Toolbox.
Theoretical calculations were demonstrated in the report of the project and the diameter of the pin was found.
In the SÄ±mulation and Results title, we can compare the results according to statical and dynamic solutions.
If I have to explain the one point about the project, The graph of 'Diameter in terms of the Force acting(Simout)' shows us the result is almost the same as time progressed.
But initially, the diameter of the pin is nearly 5 times more than calculated results even if it can be ignored.
